# autumnplot-gl Documentation Website

## Package setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Local development

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Push to the `docusaurus` branch of autumnplot-gl to build and deploy the documentation via a Github action. Don't forget to update the static assets (like pre-built files) before pushing a final version.
